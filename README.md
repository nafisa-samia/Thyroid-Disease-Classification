# Thyroid Disease Prediction using Back Propagation Neural Network

## Library Used: 
1. Numpy, Pandas : For Data processing
2. MatPlotLib, Seaborn: for visualization 
3. Scikit-learn: for confusion matrix

# Step by Step Project Details:
1. Load Thyroid Dataset
2. Normalize the Data
3. Convert the Class labels to indexes for use with neural network
4. Mark some of the data for testing purpose as we'll test our network on unseen data
5. Separate train and test Data
6. Create backpropagating neural network
7. Graphical representations of the network
8. Sigmoid function representation
9. Calculate the errror
10. Test the network for accuracy
11. Run the network with the updated weights from training
12. Calculate accuracy
12. Plot both normalized and non normalized confusion matrix

## Multi class imbalanced data
New-thyroid dataset is a multi class imbalanced data. Following is the class distribution of this dataset. 

Class Distribution: number of instances per class <br>
	Class 1: (normal)	150 <br>
	Class 2: (hyper)	35 <br>
	Class 3: (hypo)		30 <br>
  
We can correctly classify this dataset using this backpropagation neural network algorithm.
